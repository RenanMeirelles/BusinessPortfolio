# Decentralized Identity Provider

### Context
> With the unbridled expansion of Web 2.0, our information has become valuable and fragile products. **But what do we get out of it? Absolutely nothing.** Those who make billions with our information are the big players, like Google, Facebook and others.
But a movement has been going on inside web 2.0 and outside it - even laws like LGPD (Brazil) and GDPR. Web 3.0 is coming to address this. Decentralized blockchain identities (DID) allow us to be sovereign over our information. We will only be "consumed" with our consent and reward!

### Solution Overview
> DID provider is a solution that allows the user to create a valid Identity on the Ethereum blockchain (can be adapted for others). Initially, an address will be generated with a Private and Public Key (a new wallet or an imported wallet - eg MetaMask). In this wallet, an Identity will be included, where the user can input parameterized information as he deems necessary. This information can be sent to validators, who will serve as certifiers (they can be companies, people or another type of entity). Finally, consumer platforms will be able to consume this identity, just like Social Media Sign In - but always with the approval of the identity owner - and even giving a reward for it. Several monetization models were designed to make it as flexible as possible - paid, free validators, paid data consumption, etc.

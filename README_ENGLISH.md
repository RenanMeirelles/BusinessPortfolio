## Welcome to my Job Portfolio!

Hey, visitor!
I'm Renan Meirelles, from brazil, and despite of being only 30 years old, I've been working on the Technology area for more than 10 years - more specifically as a **Business Process Management professional (CBPP Certified)**. My graduation was in **Technology for Business Management at FATEC-SP** (a Technologist institution of SÃ£o Paulo state). My subsequent graduations were the experiences i've been living trough those years. Those details I'll tell you below, in this same document!

**Business Process Management** is a discipline that aims to organize and align **end to end** processes of an organization with its customers (from the inside out). In BPM there is a whole **cycle**, going through the **understanding of the organizational structure, design, analysis, implementation, control, transformation**, among other steps that may or may not occur. Currently, this discipline is strongly linked to the **TECHNOLOGY** factor. Without a good analysis of processes, it is not possible to implement systems that are 100% adherent to the business. This goes for both control and operation systems and application development!

- **Study** of the market in which the customer is inserted and initial **documentation**;
- **Business Meetings** for understanding the client's **needs / goals**;
- **Quick understanding**, mainly from the **macro view** of business processes;
- **Macro Process** and **Value Chain** modeling;
- Ease in **conducting meetings** for **business process** gathering;
- **Advanced process modeling** level in **BPMN2.0** (notation) - fast and complete;
- **Full detailed processes** (descriptions, events, actors/roles, systems, integrations, etc);
- **As Is (if necessary) and To Be** process modeling **focused or not** in **systems implementation**;
- **Process modeling** focused on several **technologies**, such as **Blockchain, Integrations, Microservices, Smart Cities, traditional systems**, among others;
- Easy identification of **bottlenecks** and proposition of **quick and viable solutions**;
- Knowledge of **various types of solutions** that can serve the business in the best possible way, **preventing the customer** from hiring very **expensive solutions without a real return to the business**.

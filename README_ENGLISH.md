I'm Renan Meirelles, from brazil, and despite of being only 30 years old, I've been working on the Technology area for more than 10 years - more specifically as a Business Process Management professional (CBPP Certified). My graduation was in  Technology for Business Management at FATEC-SP (a Technologist institution of SÃ£o Paulo state). My subsequent graduations were the experiences i've been living trough those years. Those details I'll tell you below, in this same document!
